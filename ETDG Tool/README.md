# Ethereum Transaction Data Generator (ETDG)

This folder contains the source code for ETDG, a novel tool designed to crawl Ethereum transaction data that enables researchers and practitioners to generate high-quality datasets, offering a valuable resource for developing and testing fraud detection algorithms.

The execution of ETDG mainly comprises five steps:
1. Malicious addresses and transactions extraction
2. Ethereum addresses and transactions extraction
3. Benign addresses and transactions extraction
4. Ethereum transaction fraud detection raw dataset generation
5. Raw dataset preprocessing
     * Feature extraction
     * Data balancing
     * Feature selection
