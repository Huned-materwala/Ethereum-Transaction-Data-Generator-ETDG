# Ethereum Transaction Fraud Detection (ETFD) Dataset

ETFD Dataset is a comprehensive and high-quality dataset designed to facilitate research and development in the domain of fraud transaction detection within the Ethereum blockchain. Generated by the Ethereum Transaction Data Generator (ETDG), the ETFD dataset addresses common challenges in public Ethereum fraud detection datasets, such as single cardinality, high cardinality, missing values, and data encoding issues, thereby reducing the risk of model overfitting and enhancing model performance.

The ETFD dataset contains 85,003 transaction data,14 features, and binary class labels. 42,499 transactions belong to the 'No Fraud’ class, and 42,504 belong to the ’Fraud’ class. The features are as follows:

* **blockNumber**: Number (height) of the block in which the transaction is included
* **confirmations**: The number of blocks that have been mined since the block containing the transactions. It indicates how many times the transaction has been confirmed
* **Month**: Month in which the transaction is performed
* **Day**: Day at which the transaction is performed
* **Hour**: Hour at which the transaction is performed
* **mean_value_received**: Average transaction amount received
* **variance_value_received**: Variance in the transaction amount received
* **total_received**: Total transaction amount received
* **time_diff_first_last_received**: Time difference between first and last received transactions
* **total_tx_sent**: Number of transactions sent
* **total_tx_sent_malicious**: Number of transactions sent to malicious addresses
* **total_tx_sent_unique**: Number of transactions sent to unique addresses
* **total_tx_sent_malicious_unique**: Number of transactions sent to unique malicious addresses
* **total_tx_received_malicious_unique**: Number of transactions received from unique malicious addresses
